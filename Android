--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Case Study for ANDROID-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------Understanding The developmental model:
                Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such
as smartphones and tablets.
                Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google.
                It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.
                However most devices run on the proprietary Android version developed by Google, which ship with additional proprietary closed-source software pre-installed, most notably
Google Mobile Services (GMS) which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and the associated Google Play Services development platform.
               Firebase Cloud Messaging is used for push notifications.
               While AOSP is free, the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google, which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding by "uncertified" devices outside 
their ecosystem.



----------------Licensing:
                At its core, the operating system is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is free and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache License.
                The majority of the Android platform and documentation is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.



----------------Mode of funding:
                Ads are the easiest and most common ways free apps make money.
                If you've downloaded any free application, chances are you've encountered all kinds of ads.
                In this app monetization model, you get paid every time a user views the ad, clicks on it, or installs a program directly from the advertisement.
                Android earns revenue by not incurring expenses for being any other Operating System (OS). Google is, after all, an advertising company (Its major revenue comes from 
advertising). Which means that displaying advertisements and hitting it to the right target demographic is their primary agenda.



----------------Commercial/Non-commercial use:
                One can use Android as a platform for gaining the maximum commercial profit through advertisement.
                One can sell his/her paid apps through android platform and pay a part of amount to the android.
                As Android is owned by google; there are high chances for an individual to gain the attention of max. number of people and thus it is perfect for  Advertising ,
